# Closers-2015_BOTS-_Final_Byte_Project

#Background:
We chose to build our final project around the concept of conversational commerce (#convconn) where much of future user interaction will occur within the context of a converstion.  In March 2016, the dominant players are [Slack] (www.slack.com) and in the near future, [Facebook Messenger] (https://www.messenger.com).
